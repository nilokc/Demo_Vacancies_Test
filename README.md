PS:
Developed with Java/Selenium/Cucumber combinations and tested on Firefox browser, Implemented on Intellije
I didnt add chrome browser driver to path on purpose, regarding to quick version driver releases. Sometimes chrome driver versions requires extra just in time configuration on maven builder side (For this case didnt want to take risk)
I did add browser switch options between firefox & chrome to code just for showing, so please check the requirements of test with Firefox browser.
